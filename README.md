## 🎵 Spotify API Setup

To sync with Spotify, you need to create a free application on the Spotify Developer portal.

> [!TIP]
> This only takes 2 minutes and is much more stable than standard Windows media detection.

### Step 1: Create Your App
1. Visit the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
2. Click **"Create app"** and use these settings:
    - **Redirect URIs**: `http://127.0.0.1:2408/callback`
    - **API/SDK**: Select **"Web API"**.

### Step 2: Configure Credentials
1. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
2. In the **OLED Customizer Settings**:
    - Enable **"Spotify Integration"**.
    - Paste your credentials and set the port to `2408`.
3. Click **SAVE** and restart the app.

## 🌐 Browser Sync Installation

To get high-precision data from YouTube and other web players:

1. Open your browser's **Extensions** page.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `extension` folder from this repo.

> [!NOTE]
> Browser Sync bypasses Windows SMTC limitations, providing accurate progress bars for YouTube videos.
